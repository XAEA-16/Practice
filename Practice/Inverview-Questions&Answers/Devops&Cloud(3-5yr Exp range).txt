can you rewrite in question answwer format
Absolutely! Here are the answers to your questions in a Q&A format:

1. How do you uncommit the changes that have already been pushed to GitHub?
To undo changes that have already been pushed to GitHub:

Revert: git revert <commit_id> - This creates a new commit that undoes the changes.

Reset: git reset --hard <commit_id> followed by git push --force - This resets to a previous commit and forcibly updates the remote repository (use cautiously).

2. If a file is suddenly deleted in git, how do you get it back?
To recover a deleted file:

Find the commit where the file was deleted: git log --diff-filter=D --summary

Recover the file from the commit before deletion: git checkout <commit_id>^ -- <file_path>

3. Can you increase the size of the root volume without shutting down the instance?
Yes, you can. Modify the volume size from the EC2 console or CLI, and then use the resize2fs or xfs_growfs command inside the instance to expand the filesystem.

4. If you lost the .pem file, how will you connect to EC2?
To connect without the .pem file:

Create a new key pair.

Stop the instance, detach the root volume, and attach it to another instance.

Mount the volume, replace the authorized_keys file with the new key, detach, and reattach the volume to the original instance.

5. S3 bucket having a policy for only read-only but you’re having full access for you? Can you modify S3 objects?
No, you cannot modify S3 objects if the bucket policy is set to read-only, regardless of your individual permissions.

6. What is the difference between Classic ELB and Application ELB?
Classic ELB: Supports HTTP, HTTPS, TCP, and SSL; basic routing.

Application ELB: Supports HTTP, HTTPS; advanced routing features like path-based and host-based routing, and more granular control.

7. How many subnets are assigned to the routing table?
Multiple subnets can be assigned to a single route table, but a subnet can only be associated with one route table at a time.

8. In your VPC, if all IPs are exhausted and you require more resources, how do you provision it?
Create a new VPC or add additional CIDR blocks to the existing VPC.

9. Are you only using CloudWatch for monitoring?
No, you can integrate CloudWatch with other tools like Prometheus, Grafana, or third-party services for comprehensive monitoring.

10. If you’re using load balancing in 2 availability zones, which load balancer should you use?
Use an Application Load Balancer (ALB) or Network Load Balancer (NLB) depending on the application requirements.

11. Can you write a Dockerfile to deploy a static webserver in a Linux environment?
dockerfile
FROM nginx:alpine
COPY /path/to/your/static/files /usr/share/nginx/html
EXPOSE 80
12. Is it possible to run any VM in AWS without creating any EC2 instance?
Use AWS Lambda for serverless applications or AWS Fargate to run containers without managing EC2 instances.

13. How to create a pipeline in Jenkins with 10 different stages and execute some stages based on input?
groovy
pipeline {
    stages {
        stage('Stage 1') {
            when {
                expression { params.RUN_STAGE1 == 'true' }
            }
            steps {
                // Your steps here
            }
        }
        // Define other stages similarly
    }
}
14. What are Terraform modules? Have you used any modules in the project?
Modules: Reusable configurations shared and versioned to organize and encapsulate resources.

Example:

hcl
module "vpc" {
  source = "terraform-aws-modules/vpc/aws"
  version = "2.0.0"
  // configuration
}
15. Is it possible to configure communication between two servers that have private access?
Use a VPC peering connection or VPN for secure communication between private servers in different VPCs.

16. What happens when you delete /var/lib/docker/overlay?
Deleting /var/lib/docker/overlay will delete overlay filesystem data, causing data loss for running containers. It’s not recommended unless you want to remove all Docker data.

17. Write a simple script that prints “bar” when called with “Foo” and “foo” when called with “bar”. Otherwise, print “Try again”.
python
import sys

def main():
    if len(sys.argv) != 2:
        print("Try again")
        return
    if sys.argv[1] == "Foo":
        print("bar")
    elif sys.argv[1] == "bar":
        print("foo")
    else:
        print("Try again")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
18. What are the scenarios to implement security in Kubernetes?
Use RBAC for access control.

Network policies to control traffic.

Pod security policies.

Encrypt data at rest and in transit.

Regular security audits and vulnerability scanning.

19. How would you automatically scale the Pods in your EKS application experiencing higher traffic?
Use the Horizontal Pod Autoscaler (HPA) based on metrics like CPU or memory usage.

20. How would you set up alerts for CPU usage exceeding 80% for more than 5 minutes in your EKS cluster?
Use CloudWatch Alarms with Prometheus and Alertmanager to monitor and alert on CPU usage.

21. How would you create a Grafana dashboard to visualize HTTP request latency of your applications running in EKS?
Use Prometheus to collect metrics and Grafana to visualize them. Create a Grafana dashboard and use Prometheus as the data source to query and display HTTP request latency metrics.
