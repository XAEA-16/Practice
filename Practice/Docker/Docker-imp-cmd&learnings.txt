
# CMD to Create the docker volume
docker volume create --name my-vol --opt type=none --opt device=/home/ubuntu/docker/volume --opt o=bind

# CMD to attach volume with the container 
docker run -d --mont source=<vol-name>,target=<> -p 8000:8000 <image-name>


why do i need to mention p 8000:8000
The reason you need to use -p 8000:8000 in your docker run command, even if you've used EXPOSE 8000 in your Dockerfile, 
is because EXPOSE only tells Docker that the container listens on that port. It doesn't map it to your host machine.
The -p 8000:8000 command ensures the port on your host is mapped to the port inside the container, making it accessible from outside the container.
